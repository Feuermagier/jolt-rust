# `rolt` â€” aspirationally safe Rust Jolt bindings
This crate contains a higher-level wrapper around JoltC, providing ergonomics comparable to using Jolt from C++.

The safety of this crate is currently provided on a best-effort basis.

```toml
rolt = "0.2.0"
```

For more complete and unsafe bindings, see [joltc-sys](https://crates.io/crates/joltc-sys).

Features:
- `double-precision`: Forwards to `joltc-sys/double-precision`
- `object-layer-u32`: Forwards to `joltc-sys/object-layer-u32`
